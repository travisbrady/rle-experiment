Run Length Encoding
==================

The goal here is to implement a simple program to accept a single column of strings
on stdin and print an RLE compressed version of that column to stdout to understand
a few things about performance, expressiveness and what sorts of tasks certain languages
are well-suited too.

The output is an RLE Triple of the form (value, start position, length)
